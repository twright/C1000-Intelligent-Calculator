    <title>Basic Calculations (GCSE,C1,C2)</title>
    <p>To perform a calculation, just enter it into the calculator's command box
    and press the enter key to get the result.</p>
    <p>We can start with simple arithmetic:</p>
<code>
>>> 1 + 2
= 3
>>> 4 - 2
= 2
>>> 4*2
= 27/2
>>> 1/3 + 1/2
= 5/6
>>> (2 + 3) * 4
= 20
</code>
    <p>As you can see, fractions are treated correctly so results will be given in
exact form where possible.</p>

    <p>We can also use powers with the '^' symbol (x^(1/2) = âˆšx):</p>
<code>
>>> 5^2
= 25
>>> 5^3
= 125
>>> 25^(1/2)
= 5
>>> 5^(1/2)
= 5^(1/2)
</code>
    <p>You will notice that the last result was given in exact form; to get it
    as a decimal you can either use 'setexact()' to switch between using exact
    form and decimals or the decimal function to convert a single result:</p>
<code>
>>> 5^(1/2)
= 5^(1/2)
>>> decimal (5^(1/2))
= 2.24
>>> setexact()
= 2.24
>>> 7^(1/3)
= 1.91
</code>
    <p>Note that decimal values are given to 3 significant figures by default
    (as most exam-boards require), but you can set how many are displayed with
    the <code>setprec</code> function.</p>
<code>
>>> 5^(1/2)
= 2.24
>>> setprec 10
= 2.236067977
</code>
    <p>To store answers for future use, the calculator provides upto 26 variables
    named A to Z (they must be capitalised), as well as the ans variable which
    stores the result of the previous calculation. You may use := to change a 
    variable and refer to it at any time by name:</p>
<code>
>>> 1/2
= 1/2
>>> ans - 1/3
= 1/6
>>> A := 5
= 5
>>> A^2 - A
= 20
</code>
